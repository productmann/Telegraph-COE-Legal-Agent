Hi Simon 
Hope you are well today. 
The terms from MST are quite thin and we would normally want to negotiate these. However, as these terms need to be signed today and as we have used MST before, if Richard P is happy (looped in for ease), we can sign the terms today and then circulate a retrospective CAF. 
The key things to be aware of when signing the terms as is are as follows: 
CMC cancellation: 
If we cancel any session within 4 weeks of said session, 100% of the fee will be due. As such if we needed to cancel at very short notice, we would be liable for the fee. 
If we need to re-schedule, we must give a minimum of 4 weeks’ notice, or there will be a charge. MST do not guarantee that they will be able to 
reschedule.  
MST cancellation: 
MST have wider cancellation rights and can cancel with just 24 hours’ notice. Whilst they will try to find a new trainer for the affected session, it is not guaranteed. CMC will receive a refund for the specific session if it is not possible to find a trainer for the session booked or a new date for the session. 
The T&Cs do not provide for cancellation/recourse if the trainer/sessions etc fall short of our requirements. 
Given the nature of the services, and as we have used them previously, we think that the risk is low, but the above are still things you should be aware of. 
If Richard is happy with the approach I can organise signature of the agreement, and will work with procurement on the CAF retrospectively. 
Thanks, 
Mel

Hey Simon 
Thanks - we don't appear to have anything on file so we'll review and revert
soonest. It's a very tight deadline for review, but we'll do our best. Please do get agreements to us ASAP going forward. 
@Group Procurement can you please look into whether onboarding needs to be completed and start a CAF. 
Thanks,

Hi Mel, 
I think you'll find MST is already a current TMG supplier if that helps. Thanks,

Just looping in procurement so they can help with onboard and start a CAF, as the value is over £20k.
