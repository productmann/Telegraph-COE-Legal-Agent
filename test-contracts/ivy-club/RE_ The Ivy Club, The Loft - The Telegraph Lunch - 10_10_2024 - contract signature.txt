Hey Katie 
Due to the low value of this agreement, I am comfortable for us to sign the terms as is. However, this is subject to confirmation on a few points and the business being happy/aware of the following: 
Payment terms are not 60 days per TMG standard. Please confirm finance is happy with that. Our no PO no pay wording is not included. As such, please let them know that our PO must be included on the invoice they send, prior to them sending them over. 
Please note the following wording, do you have a way to pay this on the day?: A discretionary service charge of 15.00% will be applied in respect of the food and beverages ordered by you and your guests at the Event. You must pay it at or prior to the end of the Event and before leaving the Venue. 
If we go over the minimum spend, any extra spend must be paid on the day, before leaving the event. 
If the event materially changes, they can alter the minimum spend. Their definition of material includes an increase in guest numbers (for example). 
Guest numbers must be confirmed 3 working days before the event. 
No decoration without prior approval - please seek this if you intend to take anything. Please read clause 10 re Cancellation in full and confirm you are comfortable. There is nothing re us moving the event if we want or need to (unless it is linked to clause 18, which you should also read in full). The FM rights at clause 18 only apply to them, i.e. they can cancel if they have an FM event. But ideally, we would want that right to, so we can rearrange in event of strikes for example. I’d ask them about this via email and get them to confirm if we need to move because of strike, we can and any monies paid will be transferred. 
They must approve us filming/photographing – please make them aware if we plan to do that. We cannot publicise the event without their permission – please seek this if we are planning to advertise. 
Pat in procurement will be able to confirm if we can agree to clause 17.1 re our insurance levels – please reach out to him on this point (and keep me looped in). 
The liability on us is quite wide as includes any losses (which usually we’d like to limit to reasonable and direct losses). The liability also extends to any damage caused by our guests or any contractors we use may. Our cap re liability is £5m which is very high. Please ensure the business is comfortable with this. 
Once you have answers on the points that require it, if we are happy to sign, despite the above, happy for you to organise signature. 
Can you confirm which team this sits in so I can advise re who should sign for TMG please. 
Thanks, 
Mel

Happily the minimum spend is the only fee that applies - and as we are expecting over 30 attendees, we will be easily over that. 
Thanks,

Can I check, it says there is a min spend of £2k – is there any room hire fee or is that min spend the only fee that applies?

Please can you let me know if you are happy for the below contract to be signed? 
It is an agreement for a lunch we are holding in October with a minimum spend requirement of £2,000. We have used the venue multiple times before and are comfortable with all the terms. £1,000 is required on booking to hold the space and I will make sure finance is comfortable with this arrangement.
Many thanks, 
Katie
