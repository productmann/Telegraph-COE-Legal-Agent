# Version 4.3 Updates - Lawyer Feedback Implementation

## Date
December 22, 2024

## Overview
Version 4.3 has been updated to address 5 specific points of feedback from TMG's legal team regarding terminology, formatting, and content guidelines.

---

## 🎯 Five Key Updates

### **Point 1: Use "TMG's Standard Position" Language**

**Feedback:** It should be clearer that this is TMG's standard, not just "Override terms"

**Change Made:**
- ❌ OLD: "Override terms §4.4 requires caps at 1.5x annual fees"
- ✅ NEW: "TMG's standard position is liability caps at 1.5x annual fees for general liability"

**Implementation:**
- Updated Step 4 guidance
- Added to formatting rules
- Updated example output
- Added to self-check

---

### **Point 2: Use "Clauses" Not "Sections" or "§"**

**Feedback:** English law typically refers to clauses as "clauses" rather than as sections or §

**Change Made:**
- ❌ OLD: "per section 4" or "§4.4"
- ✅ NEW: "per clause 4" or "(clause 4.4)"

**Implementation:**
- Added to CRITICAL WRITING REQUIREMENTS at top of prompt
- Updated all examples throughout
- Changed "section" references to "clause" references
- Removed § symbol entirely
- Added to self-check validation

---

### **Point 3: Use UK English Spelling**

**Feedback:** Make sure agent is using UK English

**Change Made:**
- ❌ OLD: "organization", "license", "favorable", "installments"
- ✅ NEW: "organisation", "licence", "favourable", "instalments"

**Implementation:**
- Added UK English requirement to CRITICAL WRITING REQUIREMENTS
- Updated all examples to use UK spelling
- Added to self-check: "Did I use UK English spelling?"
- Common UK vs US differences to watch:
  - organisation (not organization)
  - licence (not license) 
  - favour/favourable (not favor/favorable)
  - colour (not color)
  - customisation (not customization)
  - instalment (not installment)

---

### **Point 4: Don't Flag Standard English Law Provisions**

**Feedback:** "No exclusion for death/personal injury liability" - this is standard under English law and cannot be excluded even if not explicitly stated. Do not flag this.

**Change Made:**
- ❌ OLD: "No exclusion for death/personal injury liability, though this is standard. Override terms §4.3 confirms this cannot be excluded."
- ✅ NEW: Skip this entirely - do not flag provisions that are standard under English law

**Implementation:**
- Added specific example to Step 4:
  ```
  ❌ DO NOT say: "No exclusion for death/personal injury liability, though this is standard"
  ✅ DO say: Nothing - English law already prohibits excluding death/personal injury 
              liability, so this is not a gap to flag
  ```
- Added to "Do NOT flag provisions that are:" list:
  - Standard under English law (e.g., inability to exclude death/personal injury liability)
  - Required by statute and therefore implied even if not stated
  - Standard practice that would apply regardless of contract language
- Removed example 3.2 from formatted example (vendor cannot exclude death/personal injury)
- Added to self-check validation
- Updated "Deprioritise/Skip" section

**Rationale:** Certain protections exist under English law regardless of contract language. Flagging their absence suggests a gap that doesn't actually exist, which could mislead business teams.

### **Point 5: Never Use Em Dashes (—)**

**Feedback:** Em dashes are a clear sign that AI was used to review the contract

**Change Made:**
- ❌ OLD: "Client liable for all breakages — attributable to guest conduct — per clause 4.2"
- ✅ NEW: "Client liable for all breakages attributable to guest conduct (clause 4.2)" or use commas

**Implementation:**
- Added to CRITICAL WRITING REQUIREMENTS: "Never use em dashes (—) - use hyphens (-) or rephrase instead"
- Updated formatting rules
- Added example of incorrect vs correct usage:
  ```
  ❌ Using em dashes:
  "Client liable for all breakages and damage to equipment — attributable to guest 
   conduct — per clause 4.2."

  ✅ Using hyphens or commas:
  "Client liable for all breakages and damage to equipment attributable to guest 
   conduct (clause 4.2)."
  ```
- Added to self-check: "Did I avoid em dashes (—) and use hyphens (-) or commas instead?"

**Technical Note:** Em dashes (—) are longer than hyphens (-) and are often auto-inserted by AI writing tools. Humans typically use hyphens or commas for similar purposes.

## 🎓 Key Principles Reinforced

### 1. **Cultural Authenticity**
Using UK English spelling, terminology, and legal conventions makes output appear naturally written by a UK lawyer, not AI-generated or US-based.

### 2. **Legal Accuracy**
Not flagging provisions that are standard under English law prevents misleading business teams about actual contractual gaps.

### 3. **TMG Branding**
Consistently referencing "TMG's standard position" reinforces that these are the company's requirements, not external legal standards.

### 4. **Human-like Output**
Avoiding em dashes (a common AI writing tell) makes output indistinguishable from human-written reviews.

### 5. **Professional Convention**
Using "clauses" for contract provisions follows standard English legal practice and matches how TMG's lawyers actually write.
