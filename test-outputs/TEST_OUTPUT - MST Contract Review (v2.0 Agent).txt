Subject: RE: Media Sales Training Limited - Training Services Agreement

**KEY BUSINESS RISKS**

- **Asymmetric cancellation terms expose company to financial penalties**: If Chelsea Magazines needs to cancel any session within 4 weeks (e.g., due to staff illness, urgent business needs, budget changes), 100% of the session fee is payable—that's £2,085 + VAT per workshop. Meanwhile, MST can cancel with just 24 hours' notice with only a refund obligation and no compensation for business disruption or last-minute rescheduling costs. Override terms §8.1 requires balanced termination rights with remedy periods.

- **No recourse for poor service quality or trainer issues**: If training sessions are poorly delivered, trainers are unqualified or inexperienced, or the programme fails to meet needs, the contract provides no termination right, service credits, performance guarantees, or quality standards—only the option to not book future sessions while remaining liable for cancellation fees on scheduled ones. Override terms §7.1 requires fitness-for-purpose warranties and professional standards.

- **No protection if MST causes business losses**: If MST's negligence causes issues (e.g., confidential client data or sales strategies shared externally, business disruption from trainer no-shows), there's no liability cap or indemnification—the company could face unlimited exposure with no contractual recourse. Override terms §§4.1, 4.4 require supplier indemnities and liability caps at 1.5x annual fees (£26,808 here) to keep risk proportionate to contract value.

- **Payment required before invoice received**: The payment schedule specifies fixed payment dates (e.g., "paid by 17 September") but doesn't condition payment on receipt of valid VAT invoices referencing services, dates, and PO numbers—creating risk of payment disputes or incorrect invoicing. Override terms §2 conditions all payments on receipt of proper invoices.

**COMPREHENSIVE OVERRIDE TERMS REVIEW**

*Liability & Indemnification*
- No supplier indemnities: Contract lacks indemnification from MST for IP infringement (training materials), confidentiality breaches, or data protection violations. Override terms §4.1 requires comprehensive supplier indemnities covering these areas.
- No insurance requirement: No obligation for MST to maintain professional indemnity insurance despite providing professional training services. Override terms §4.2 requires suppliers to maintain appropriate insurance coverage.
- Missing liability exclusions clause: No standard provision preserving liability for death/personal injury from negligence or fraud. Override terms §4.3 requires these statutory exclusions.
- No liability cap framework: Contract contains no limitation on either party's liability exposure for any claims. Override terms §4.4 requires TMG's liability capped at 1.5x annual fees (£26,808) for general claims and £2M for data protection breaches.

*Data Protection*
- No data processing framework: Agreement lacks designation of controller/processor roles, data processing provisions, or UK GDPR Article 28 terms despite both parties likely handling personal data (delegate information, client data shared during training). Override terms §§5-6 require comprehensive Data Protection Laws compliance clauses (either controller-to-controller or controller-to-processor as appropriate).
- Inadequate confidentiality provisions: While clause 7 addresses confidentiality, it doesn't specifically address data protection compliance, technical/organizational security measures, encryption requirements, or breach notification obligations required under Data Protection Laws definition in Override terms §§4.5, 5.3.

*Warranties*
- Missing standard supplier warranties: No warranty that MST will perform with due diligence, skill, care, in a professional, timely and workmanlike manner. Override terms §7.1.3 requires this.
- No deliverables quality warranty: No warranty that training deliverables are of good quality, conform to descriptions/specifications, or fit for purpose. Override terms §7.1.4 requires fitness-for-purpose warranties.
- No personnel standards: No warranty that MST will use suitably skilled and experienced trainers in sufficient number, despite the contract mentioning "suitable replacement trainer of equivalent experience." Override terms §7.1.5 requires personnel quality warranties.
- No compliance warranties: No warranty that MST will comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, licenses and consents. Override terms §7.1.6 requires legal compliance warranties.
- No health & safety provisions: No warranties regarding Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 compliance despite trainers working at Chelsea Magazines' premises. Override terms §7.1.7 requires H&S compliance warranties and policy statement availability.
- No reputational protection: No warranty that MST won't damage Chelsea Magazines' reputation. Override terms §7.1.8 requires this protection.

*Termination Rights*
- No material breach termination right: TMG lacks the right to terminate for material breach by MST (e.g., persistent poor quality, confidentiality breaches) with 30-day cure period. Override terms §8.1.1 requires this.
- No repeated breach termination: No right to terminate for repeated minor breaches indicating inability/unwillingness to perform. Override terms §8.1.2 requires this.
- No insolvency termination: No termination rights if MST enters administration, receivership, winding up, or becomes insolvent. Override terms §8.1.3 requires comprehensive insolvency termination rights.
- No reputational termination: Missing provision allowing termination if MST's actions risk bringing Chelsea Magazines into serious disrepute. Override terms §8.2 requires mutual reputational termination rights.

*Payment & Commercial Terms*
- Invoice conditioning missing: Payment schedule doesn't condition payment on receipt of valid VAT invoices referencing services, dates, and TMG PO numbers. Override terms §2 requires invoicing preconditions.
- No fee increase controls: While this is a fixed-price contract, there's no protection against automatic fee increases if the relationship continues or renews. Override terms §1 caps automatic increases to lesser of CPI or 2.5% annually.

*Assignment & Subcontracting*
- No assignment restrictions: Contract lacks provisions restricting either party from assigning or subcontracting without consent, except the narrow restriction on sharing training materials. Override terms §3 requires mutual consent for assignment with TMG carve-out for M&A transactions.
- Insufficient subcontracting controls: While clause 5(b) mentions "replacement trainer," there's no general prohibition or consent requirement for MST subcontracting training delivery to third parties.

*Agreement Governance*
- Entire agreement clause inadequate: Clause 8 states this "constitutes the entire agreement" but lacks integration language about superseding prior agreements or representations, and doesn't address governing law or jurisdiction. Override terms framework assumes comprehensive commercial governance provisions.
- No amendment formality: While modifications must be "agreed in writing," there's no specification of authorized signatories or amendment process.
- Missing standard provisions: No provisions addressing notices, dispute resolution, severability, waiver, force majeure, or relationship of parties (independent contractor status).
